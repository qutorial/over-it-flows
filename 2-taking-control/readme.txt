1. Meet the 'control' program

This is a program of which you will take control in this tutorial.
But first run it and check what it can do:

```
make
$ ./control 
Press Ctrl+C or type end to quit
Command: help
	dir - lists the current directory
	cd [folder] - switches the current directory
	end - leave the program
	help - shows this help
```

Try playing with it.

Can you find a problem in it giving it some unusual input?
